    <!-- Steps to prepare the recipe -->
    <h4>Steps to Prepare</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix yeast and sugar with warm water. Let sit until bubbles form, about 5 minutes.</li> 
        <li>Add flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt to the yeast mixture. Mix until dough comes together, then increase speed to medium-low until dough is sticky, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the top of the dough with remaining olive oil, flip to coat, cover, and let rise for 1 hour and 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 500°F (260°C) with a pizza stone on the upper third rack.</li>
        <li>Cut dough in half, form into rounds, and let rise on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>On a floured surface, press one round into an 8-inch circle, then stretch to a 12-inch circle.</li>
        <li>Place dough on a piece of heavy-duty foil on an upside-down half-sheet pan, brush with olive oil, and dust with flour.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of grated parmesan, spread 1/2 cup of pizza sauce, and add 1 1/2 cups of low-moisture mozzarella and 1/2 cup of cubed fresh mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Transfer pizza with foil to the preheated baking stone, and bake until crust is browned and cheese is bubbling, about 12-14 minutes.</li>
        <li>Brush the crust with olive oil, sprinkle with basil, and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
