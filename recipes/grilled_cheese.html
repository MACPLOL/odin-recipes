    <!-- Ingredients -->
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread: 2 slices (preferably 1/2-inch thick sourdough or white sandwich bread)</li>
        <li>Butter: 2 teaspoons (softened)</li>

    <!-- Steps to prepare the recipe -->
    <h4>Steps to Prepare</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the Skillet: Place a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Butter the Bread: Spread 1 teaspoon of softened butter on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
        <li>Add the Cheese: Place one slice of bread, buttered side down, in the skillet. Sprinkle the grated cheese evenly over the bread.</li>
        <li>Top with the Other Slice: Place the second slice of bread on top, buttered side up.</li>
        <li>Cook the Sandwich: Cover the skillet and cook until the bottom slice of bread is golden brown and crisp, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the sandwich, replace the lid, and cook until the other slice of bread is golden brown and the cheese is melted, 1 to 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to low if the bread is getting too brown before the cheese is fully melted.</li>
        <li>Serve: Remove the sandwich from the skillet, slice in half diagonally, and serve immediately.</li>    
    </ol>
